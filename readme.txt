== Description ==

Add layered content with the Layers companion plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/layers/. Trying to make the best darn, always free theme that I can. 2 menu areas, 3 widget areas, 2 page templates, easily upload a custom logo, background, add Google fonts, and more. Fully responsive with WooCommerce and bbPress support built right in. Being carefully coded with quality and minimalism, Stripes manages to pack a punch and remain blazing-fast, without all the bloat.
